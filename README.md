# binary-search-tree
This assignment is part of The Odin Project's full stack javascript curriculum.
See [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-binary-search-trees) for project specs. 

# objective 
The objective of this assignment is to 

* understand the algorithm to build a binary search tree 
* build a binary search tree with given instructions 
# features 
This binary tree doesn't deal with duplicate values. 

* buildBST(arr) - takes an array of data and turns it into a balanced binary tree 
* insert - inserts a data to the tree 
* remove - deletes a data from the tree
* find - returns a node with given data 
* getHeight - returns the height of the tree 
* levelOrder - console logs the level order traversal of the tree 
* preOrder - console logs the pre order traversal of the tree 
* postOrder - console logs the post order traversal of the tree 
* getDepth- returns the node's depth 
* isBalanced - returns true if the tree is balanced, else returns false 
* rebalance - rebalances the unbalanced tree and returns it
# for improvement 
- [ ] fix traversal functions to accept a callback function
